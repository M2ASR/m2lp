INTRODUCTION
------------

M2LP is part of the M2ASR projected, and it is an open-source package for multi-minority langauge processing tasks.

Multi-Minority Automatic Speech Recognition (M2ASR) is an NSFC-supported project, with the aim of providing speech
recognition service for minority nations of China. We are planning to investigate, develope and architect the ASR
service within 5 years. We will pulish all the tools, data, model, and service for free. 

M2ASR is a multi-party project involing  CSLt@Tsinghua Unviersity, Xinjiang University, Northwest University for Nations (NUW).
M2LP provides the basic functions for langauge processing, including text normalization, morphology segmentation,
langauge modeling, and all the related resources, functions, and tools. 

The basic design principle is reusable and modulation. The functions will be implemented as functions written by 
c/c++, python or perl, and the recipe will be a shell script that integrating modules by piple line.
